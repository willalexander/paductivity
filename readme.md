<p>I wrote this app in 2010/2011 for the early iterations of the iPad.
<p>There was no split-screen multi tasking at the time, so I developed this app which allows the user to divide the screen into 
multiple sub-apps which could be used simultaneously. The options were: a note taking app, a calendar, a web browser and a calculator. 
The app was rejected by Apple for breaching guidelines (no split screen apps allowed!)
<p>Written in C++ and Objective-C.
<p>Supports iOS 4 and below.
